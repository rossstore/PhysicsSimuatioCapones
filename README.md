# PhysicsSimuationCapones
This Java program simulates the motion of a projectile based on user input, calculating properties such as maximum height, time of flight, horizontal range, and the trajectory points of the projectile over time. The program uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface) created with Swing components, allowing the user to input values like initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration. After entering the values, the program calculates and displays the results, including the projectile's motion details, in a user-friendly format.

The main features of this program include:

Input Fields for velocity, launch angle, and gravity.
Calculate Button to trigger the computation of projectile properties.
Output Area to display results, including the calculated max height, time of flight, range, and trajectory data (time, x, y).
Error Handling to ensure proper input is provided (e.g., numeric values only).
Steps to Run the Program in NetBeans:
Create a New Java Project:

Open NetBeans IDE.
Click on File > New Project.
Select Java under "Categories" and Java Application under "Projects".
Click Next, name your project (e.g., PhysicsSimulation), and click Finish.
Create a New Java Class:

In the Projects window, right-click the default package under Source Packages and select New > Java Class.
Name the class PhysicsSimulationGUI and click Finish.
This will create a new class in your project.
Paste the Code:

Copy the provided Java code for the Projectile Simulation with GUI.
Paste the code into the newly created class (PhysicsSimulationGUI.java), replacing any auto-generated content.
Run the Program:

Save your file (Ctrl + S).
Click the Run button (green arrow) in the toolbar or press Shift + F6.
The GUI window will open.
Input and View Results:

In the GUI, enter values for initial velocity, launch angle, and gravity (e.g., 9.8 m/sÂ²).
Press the Calculate button to see the results displayed in the text area, including the maximum height, time of flight, range, and trajectory points.
Summary:
This project provides an interactive Java Swing GUI for simulating the motion of a projectile. It allows users to input physical parameters, calculates the projectile's behavior, and displays detailed results through an easy-to-use interface. The program uses standard Java components (no external libraries required) and performs calculations based on basic physics equations for projectile motion.
